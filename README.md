# tree-model
Code for the chapter "The Tree Model" (Pellard, Ryder &amp; Jacques 2024)

All figures in the chapter can be reproduced using the R code from file TreeModel.R

Most figures rely on the trees in the file SinoTibetanSubset.nex, which was obtained by subsetting certain languages from the file https://github.com/lingpy/sino-tibetan-paper/blob/master/BeastFiles/sinotibetan-beast-covarion-relaxed-fbd.trees (Sagart et al. 2019, *Dated language phylogenies shed light on the ancestry of Sino-Tibetan*, PNAS)

The files in the folder xval are used for the figure on cross-validation of language ages.
