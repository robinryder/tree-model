All figures in the chapter can be reproduced using the R code from file `FiguresTreeModel.R`. The necessary data files are found in the `data` folder.

Most figures rely on the trees in the file SinoTibetanSubset.nex, which was obtained by subsetting certain languages from the file https://github.com/lingpy/sino-tibetan-paper/blob/master/BeastFiles/sinotibetan-beast-covarion-relaxed-fbd.trees (Sagart, Laurent, Guillaume Jacques, Yunfan Lai, Robin J. Ryder, Valentin Thouzeau, Simon J. Greenhill & Johann-Mattis List. 2019. Dated language phylogenies shed light on the ancestry of Sino-Tibetan. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 116(21). 10317–10322. <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817972116>).
